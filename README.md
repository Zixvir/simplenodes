A release with "simplenodes" in the name has the entire simplenodes package in expanded form.
Code that is in Expanded Form is easy to build your own classes off of.

A release with a node class/interface in the name is in Compressed Form
Compressed means that all the code from all inherited classes / interfaces has been "compressed" into a single class, and that any subinterfaces/subclasses have been removed. 

If you want to extend a class from Simple Nodes, I recommend getting it in Expanded form. If you just want to use a node from Simple Nodes, I recommend getting it in compressed form.
